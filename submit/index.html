	From Joni: Overall Comments

	Hi Linda!  I will be adding comments to your code in HTML comments like this one.

	Overall, this is a fantastic submission.  There are some spacing issues in the header, but the rest of the
	page looks solid on the front end.

	Also, great job with indenting your HTML.

			<!-- Strings of class names like this is where the class strategy could get a bit unwieldy.  You can also style your elements by adding 1 class - for example <a class="signUpButton"> - and putting all of the styles for this button under that one class.  There is nothing wrong with this strategy from a "does it work" perspective.  Like I said in class, there are a lot of ways to code something that will work.  It is more a matter of coding style, personal preferences, and maintainablilty later on. -->
